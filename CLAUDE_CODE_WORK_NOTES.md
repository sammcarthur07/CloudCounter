# Claude Code Work Notes - CloudCounter Session

## Date: 2025-09-01

### Issues Fixed in This Session:

#### 1. Retroactive Activity Dialog Issues
**Problems:**
- Initial highlight text was showing white instead of grey when popup opened
- Quantity button "1" was always grey regardless of selection state
- When selecting different quantity buttons, text colors weren't updating correctly
- "No spacing" option was only adding 1 activity instead of the specified number

**Solutions:**
- Fixed initial text colors by setting grey (#1E1E1E) for selected items on initialization
- Fixed quantity button behavior to properly toggle between white (unselected) and grey (selected)
- Changed timestamp spacing from 10ms to 100ms for "no spacing" option to ensure uniqueness
- Fixed text color reset logic using `layout.childCount` instead of `childCount`

#### 2. Multi-Add Smoker Switching Bug
**Problem:**
- When adding multiple activities with "no spacing", activities were being assigned to different smokers
- Auto-advance was kicking in between bulk additions

**Solution:**
- Temporarily disable auto-advance mode during bulk adds
- Store original spinner position and restore it if changed
- Re-enable auto-advance after bulk operation completes
- Keep using original `logHit` function (not `logHitForSpecificSmoker` which wasn't working)

#### 3. Long Press Vibration
**Problem:**
- Vibration for long press wasn't working as expected

**Solution:**
- Changed vibration duration from 1500ms to 2000ms (2 seconds)

#### 4. Session Stats Display Improvements
**Problems:**
- "Last cone" stat was on a separate line instead of next to Rounds
- Missing information about who had the last joint and bowl

**Solutions:**
- Moved "Last cone" to same line as "Total cones" and "Rounds" with pipe separators
- Added display for last joint and last bowl smoker info below the stats
- Each activity type shows on its own line (if available):
  - "{Name} had the last cone {time} ago"
  - "{Name} had the last joint {time} ago"  
  - "{Name} had the last bowl {time} ago"
- Only shows activities that have actually occurred (no empty lines)

### Files Modified:
1. `MainActivity.kt` - Fixed retroactive dialog, multi-add logic, and vibration
2. `SeshFragment.kt` - Improved stats display layout

### Git Commits:
1. "Fix retroactive activity dialog issues" - Contains all dialog and multi-add fixes
2. Next commit will contain the stats display improvements

### Technical Details:
- The multi-add issue was caused by async processing where auto-advance would trigger between activities
- The stats already had the data (`lastJointSmokerName`, `lastBowlSmokerName`) in GroupStats class
- Text color issues were due to incorrect scope in loop iterations

### Testing Notes:
- All changes tested with logcat monitoring
- Verified multi-add works correctly with all time modes
- Confirmed vibration works on long press
- Stats display updates properly with all activity types
